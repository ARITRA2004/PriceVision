* Why Blip-2?
    * I use BLIP-2 because it converts raw images into meaningful, searchable text with good accuracy, without needing to train a vision model, and it works well as a first-stage product understanding model.



# Configuration of files

* For client folder
    * I am using Parcel as the bundler.




# what error i have faced

* I have to include the "React" library to all files where I use the "jsx"
